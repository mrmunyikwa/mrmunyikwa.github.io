&lt;p>For several years, I worked with a team to develop and run a course for first year medical students titled Doctoring 1A: Introduction to Medicine and Society. A summary of our initial concept of the course can be found in this article, which describes the philosophy and general structure of the course sessions:

&lt;p>My dissertation project, &lt;em>Up from the Dirt: Racializing Refuge, Rupture, and Repair in Philadelphia&lt;/em>, was based upon years of ethnographic observation, interviews, and archival research in Philadelphia among organizations that care for and resettle refugees. My dissertation places care for refugees and other humanitarian migrants in political, economic, and social context with a particular emphasis on broader patterns of racial discrimination and state-sanctioned violence. Responding to that, the project explores the intersection of care and governance in Philadelphia through the lens of displacement, beginning with an ethnographic study of refugees and the institutions in Philadelphia that serve them. I analyze Philadelphia as a place formed through migration and displacement, from successive refugee migrations beginning in the 20th century to other movements, like the Great Migration, that have shaped demographic patterns and social life in the city of Brotherly Love. Drawing from a large, diverse archive that brings news, personal narratives and oral histories, and cultural representations both past and present into conversation with semi-structured interviews and ethnographic participant-observation at multiple sites, my work strives to understand what making refuge looks like and for whom asylum is possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My analytic framework draws from literatures about humanitarianism, affect, and the anthropology of the state to understand how refugee resettlement in Philadelphia is inflected with the politics of race, gender, and class. Drawing from feminist theory and queer of color critique, I explore comparative racialization through a framework that recognizes how groups are racialized with respect to one another through competing racial formations at the same time that it accounts for heterogeneity within racial categories. I do so through a particular attentiveness to state bureaucratic processes, from welfare applications to public health management, as they are negotiated by healthcare providers, case workers, and volunteers, not to mention refugees and asylum seekers themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a Black woman, an immigrant, and a future health care provider, I try to think carefully about the social, political, and economic dynamics that care – however well-intentioned – both shapes and is shaped by. I’m also hopeful that in theorizing displacement and refuge, we can reconsider what justice can and should look like for racialized people. Thinking as such might allow us to imagine a reparative politics that offers new possibilities for the future.&lt;/p>

In my mind, what links my seemingly disparate careers in medicine and anthropology is the centrality and importance of teaching. For me, learning to be an educator is one of the most vital components of being a clinician-scholar: it allows us to both disseminate and produce new knowledge, it provides a pipeline of future scholars, and it is an avenue for justice and equity in research and education. My teaching philosophy draws from my background and training as a future clinician/anthropologist and enables students at several levels (undergraduate, graduate, and medical school) to develop the tools to understand complex issues at the intersection of medicine and society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the undergraduate level, I have served as a teaching assistant for both large survey courses and small upper-division seminars. I&amp;rsquo;ve also designed courses in medical anthropology at multiple universities. My undergraduate courses emphasize growth and maturation over initial competence, rewarding students for their efforts to become more effective thinkers and writers through low-stakes assignments early in the semester that build confidence and allow learners to acclimate to the challenges of thinking anthropologically. Through in-class exercises like debates and media critiques, we work together as a class to collectively produce knowledge that draws upon their personal experiences of health and healing and contextualizes their narratives within the communities in which they live. Further, learners understand the complexities of caregiving across settings, in particular the unintended consequences of these practices. On my journey to becoming an educator, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken courses in teaching at the college level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I developed a similar approach at the medical school level, where I have been involved in course design, implementation, and evaluation for a required course in the medical social sciences. For two years, I served as the Course Liaison for the School of Medicine’s introductory social medicine course,
&lt;a href="/page/health-equity-medical-education/#Doctoring-IA">Doctoring IA: Introduction to Medicine and Society&lt;/a>. As co-director of the course, I selected weekly lecturers and course readings that could appeal to 165 students with varying levels of exposure and interest in the medical humanities and social sciences, social medicine, and public health. Through a certificate in medical education at Penn, I am strengthening my skills as a clinical educator, from the classroom to the wards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My second major project, &lt;em>Inheritance&lt;/em>, picks up on the themes of trauma, history, and memory that my first project elaborated. This project will be examining how patients, scholars, and physicians conceptualize the process of inheritance, particularly when it comes to the biological consequences of social inequality. In examining the fields of epigenetics and the embodiment of trauma, I hope to draw upon critical anthropological studies of violence, historical memory, psychoanalysis, and methods in cultural and biocultural anthropology.&lt;/p>
