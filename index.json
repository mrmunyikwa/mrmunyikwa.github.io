I defended my dissertation, Up from the Dirt: Racializing Refuge, Rupture, and Repair in Philadelphia, in 2019. Now I am a current resident physician in combined internal medicine and pediatrics.\nPrior to my time at Penn, I studied at the College of William and Mary, where I was a Murray 1693 Scholar. I graduated in 2011 with a self-designed major in Biochemistry \u0026amp; Molecular Biology and a second major in Anthropology. As an undergrad at William \u0026amp; Mary, I spent much of my time in biology labs, studying molecular biology through the intricacies of protein signaling pathways. This work culminated in my honors thesis. I subsequently spent a brief time at Merck Research Laboratories, where I discovered that while I was passionate about the molecular pathways that lead to disease, I yearned to know more about the other paths – historical, social, political-economic – that structure patterns of health and illness. These interests led me to the combined study of medicine and anthropology.\nA political and medical anthropologist by training, I am most interested in understanding the relationship between political economy, history, and practices of care. My dissertation research explored the experiences of refugees and asylum seekers in Philadelphia and the institutions designed to care for them. I have also conducted research on political ideology in the United States, the use of race in biomedicine, and human rights \u0026amp; humanitarianism both domestically and abroad. Clinically, I am interested in work at the intersection of medicine, rights, and the law and have frequently collaborated with lawyers to advocate for patients.\nAside from research, I am passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration, education at all levels, and service.\nIn my non-academic life, I’m a voracious reader and lifelong diarist, am a consummate digital hoarder and technology fiend, and feel lucky to call the city of Brotherly Love my home.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/michelle-munyikwa-phd/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/michelle-munyikwa-phd/","section":"authors","summary":"Welcome!\nI recently graduated from the joint MD/PhD program in anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania in 2021.

Updates forthcoming.\nI often receive emails from students who are wondering whether they should pursue medical school, a PhD in anthropology, or both. Because I often have these conversations, I have a sense that there is a dearth of information out there about this career path despite a growing interest in it. This page is an attempt to collect some of my thoughts about dual careers in medicine and anthropology. My thoughts on this are certainly neither exhaustive nor sufficient, but I hope this is one of many resources you can consider as you think about whether to embark upon this path. The other resource I would recommend is the list of physician-scientist programs in anthropology, which you can find here. While the list is always changing, this will give you a good starting place from which to see what schools you might consider attending should you want dual training.\nHere are some answers to the questions that people ask me about this path:\nShould I get an MD/PhD in anthropology? Is it a good idea? Is it worth all the time?\nBy the time you talk to someone in my position, they will likely have a polished answer to this question, giving you the impression that MD/PhD anthropology students were always certain that this is what they wanted to do. While this might be the case for some people, it certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case for me. Deciding to do this was complicated, and at least for me, involved a lot of uncertainty. Here are some questions I normally pose to students when they ask me whether this is the right fit for them:\n What kind of research do you want to do? Which discipline asks the questions you like to ask and answers them in a way that excites you? (Is it possible that you prefer similar \u0026ndash; but different! \u0026ndash; disciplines like public health, health policy, or bioethics?) Do you want to see patients, or would you be happy if you worked in the sphere of health? Do you want to be a clinician, researcher, or both? What are your personal life goals? In ten years, what things would have to be true in order for you to be happy? Graduate school and medical school, in most places, will be very culturally different. Do you prefer your time to be structured by other people or by yourself? Do you feel flexible about switching between the two? What kinds of skills will you need to do the things that you want? What are your strengths, and where do you have room for growth? What specialties are you interested in? Are these specialties traditionally ones which allow for robust careers in research? What kinds of financial resources do you have, and what are your financial goals? Are they compatible with an extended period living on a graduate student salary? What benefits do your prospective programs offer?  The answer to these questions can absolutely be I don\u0026rsquo;t know! but they are starting points for reflection about what might be right for you. I also often suggest to students that they take a period of time to read from different fields and ask themselves what kinds of scholarship they enjoy reading. Books? Short articles? Qualitative or quantitative work? Research papers or advocacy? Journalism or scholarship? Remember that enjoying reading a particular kind of scholarship is not the same as wanting to produce it, so thinking about the process of research in different fields and whether it suits you can be important as well.\nUltimately, I love being an anthropologist, and I would highly recommend training in anthropology. If you need to talk through whether it\u0026rsquo;s right for you \u0026ndash; and whether a dual career makes sense for your goals \u0026ndash; reaching out to mentors who are faculty that you admire and students you hope to emulate is a great first start.\nDo you think I\u0026rsquo;m competitive for programs?\nI sincerely wish I knew the answer to this, but being competitive for these programs is multi-factorial. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to talk through your concerns with you and establish a plan for getting you towards your goals.\nWhere do you recommend I look for community and mentorship?\nAs a first step, I highly recommend that, if you are able, you attend the National Conference for Physician-Scholars in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Every other year, trainees and faculty gather to discuss research \u0026amp; strengthen our community. While there is strong representation from anthropology and history, each year an increasing number of sociologists, public health scholars, epidemiologists, and other social scientists or humanists attend. If you are unable to make it, one resource which could show you the diversity of careers and research are the programs from prior years of the conference. Through the lists of presentations, you are likely to find scholars doing work that\u0026rsquo;s interesting to you and it may point you to people and institutions that share your interests.\n","date":1590024177,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590024177,"objectID":"9d9d68908a12c6967b7e69f401d2cfa8","permalink":"/page/for-prospective-students/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T21:22:57-04:00","relpermalink":"/page/for-prospective-students/","section":"page","summary":"This page is a work in progress, but as application season is coming up, I wanted to put this out there!

My dissertation places care for refugees and other humanitarian migrants in political, economic, and social context with a particular emphasis on broader patterns of racial discrimination and state-sanctioned violence. The project explores the intersection of care and governance in Philadelphia through the lens of displacement, beginning with an ethnographic study of refugees and the institutions in Philadelphia that serve them. I analyze Philadelphia as a place formed through migration and displacement, from successive refugee migrations beginning in the 20th century to other movements, like the Great Migration, that have shaped demographic patterns and social life in the city of Brotherly Love. Drawing from a large, diverse archive that brings news, personal narratives \u0026amp; oral histories, and cultural representations both past and present into conversation with semi-structured interviews and ethnographic participant-observation at multiple sites, my work strives to understand what making refuge looks like and for whom asylum is possible.\nMy analytic framework draws from literatures about humanitarianism, affect, and the anthropology of the state to understand how refugee resettlement in Philadelphia is inflected with the politics of race, gender, and class. Drawing from feminist theory and queer of color critique, I explore comparative racialization through a framework that recognizes how groups are racialized with respect to one another through competing racial formations at the same time that it accounts for heterogeneity within racial categories. I do so through a particular attentiveness to state bureaucratic processes, from welfare applications to public health management, as they are negotiated by healthcare providers, case workers, and volunteers, not to mention refugees and asylum seekers themselves.\nAs a Black woman, an immigrant, and a future health care provider, I try to think carefully about the social, political, and economic dynamics that shape care and its unintended consequences. I’m also hopeful that in theorizing displacement and refuge, we can reconsider what justice can and should look like for racialized people. Thinking as such might allow us to imagine a reparative politics that offers new possibilities for the future.\nRelated Articles \u0026amp; Other Publications While my dissertation is not currently publicly available, you can read an abstract of the dissertation here.

In my mind, what links my seemingly disparate careers in medicine and anthropology is the centrality and importance of teaching. For me, learning to be an educator is one of the most vital components of being a clinician-scholar: it allows us to both disseminate and produce new knowledge, it provides a pipeline of future scholars, and it is an avenue for justice and equity in research and education. My teaching philosophy draws from my background and training as a future clinician/anthropologist and enables students at several levels (undergraduate, graduate, and medical school) to develop the tools they need to understand complex issues at the intersection of medicine and society.\nAt the undergraduate level, I have served as a teaching assistant for both large survey courses and small upper-division seminars. I\u0026rsquo;ve also designed courses in medical anthropology at multiple universities. My undergraduate courses emphasize growth and maturation over initial competence, rewarding students for their efforts to become more effective thinkers and writers through low-stakes assignments early in the semester that build confidence and allow learners to acclimate to the challenges of thinking anthropologically. Through in-class exercises like debates and media critiques, we work together as a class to collectively produce knowledge that draws upon their personal experiences of health and healing and contextualizes their narratives within the communities in which they live. Further, learners understand the complexities of caregiving across settings, in particular the unintended consequences of these practices. On my journey to becoming an educator, I\u0026rsquo;ve also taken courses in teaching \u0026amp; pedagogy at the college level.\nI developed a similar approach at the medical school level, where I have been involved in course design, implementation, and evaluation for a required course in the medical social sciences. For two years, I served as the Course Liaison for the School of Medicine’s introductory social medicine course, Doctoring IA: Introduction to Medicine and Society. As co-director of the course, I selected weekly lecturers and course readings that could appeal to 165 students with varying levels of exposure and interest in the medical humanities and social sciences, social medicine, and public health. Through a certificate in medical education at Penn, I am strengthening my skills as a clinical educator, from the classroom to the wards.\nFor copies of my syllabi, please e-mail me.\n","date":1589917438,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589917438,"objectID":"9b99810a45e0a5f0aa081103d67301a9","permalink":"/page/teaching/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T15:43:58-04:00","relpermalink":"/page/teaching/","section":"page","summary":"I love teaching and mentorship.

At the time, I thought this would be a simple task. I would identify those relationships - or perhaps more accurately, those people - who were problematic or with whom I was holding onto anger, and I would let it go. Just like that, I\u0026rsquo;d be unfettered by rage, despair, disappointment, and bitterness. Much like dusting out a closet at the onset of spring, I\u0026rsquo;d find myself lighter, freer, and however briefly tidier, all in an afternoon\u0026rsquo;s work. Lest you be fooled into thinking that I am a particularly excellent person, I will be the first to admit that I entered this project with the misplaced hubris with which I often begin my personal endeavors. Simply put, a not insignificant part of me imagined that forgiveness would be as simple as declaring that I had forgiven and forgetting anything ever happened. Just like that, I would let bygones be bygones.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure you see where this is going. In practice, letting go is not that simple. First, it was an exercise in patience - with myself, with the other person, with the slow process of rebuilding or recrafting a relationship. Second, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t seem to forget. Around this time, I reread Avery Gordon\u0026rsquo;s Ghostly Matters and was captivated by her metaphor of haunting, of the ghosts that lie just below the surface of the present; in my mind, her writing captures perfectly the problem of forgiving and forgetting. There is no forgetting \u0026ndash; that which we are aiming to suppress lies just beyond reach, salient and important nonetheless. But more importantly, it captures the historically-imbued nature of the present: in other words, how the past seeps into the present in unexpected and often unacknowledged ways. Despite my efforts, it was often the case that while trying to interact with or think about Person I Have Forgiven, there was always, frustratingly, a touch of Person Who Has Done Me Wrong in the mix.\nNow, seeing as my job as an anthropologist is to extract every last morsel of meaning out of the mundane, everyday ordinariness of fleeting interactions and developing relationships, this fixation with forgiveness and haunting seeped slowly into my intellectual life. And, in the wake of a series of events on my campus honoring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I found myself reading his work on love and forgiveness: in particular, his writing on loving your enemies. Of loving our enemies, he writes that it is first important that we learn to forgive, for \u0026ldquo;He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. It is impossible even to begin the act of loving one’s enemies without the prior acceptance of the necessity, over and over again, of forgiving those who inflict evil and injury upon us.\u0026quot; And while people can ask us to forgive them, he notes, he suggests that the forgiving act must be \u0026ldquo;initiated by the person who has been wronged, the victim of some great hurt, the recipient of some tortuous injustice, the absorber of some terrible act of oppression.\u0026quot; I start with this, and with Martin Luther King, Jr. not only because he has recently been commemorated but also because of the particular hold that his legacy has in the imagination of a better, more just world. But also, as I think through emotions and their link to the political imagination, I\u0026rsquo;m captivated by King\u0026rsquo;s use of the emotions to rouse the sentiments of the nation (and I\u0026rsquo;m not the only one: see, for example, this report describing King as an emotionally intelligent leader, or the many analyses of the potency of King\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;I Have a Dream\u0026rdquo; speech).\nAs I start thinking through the \u0026ldquo;cultural politics of emotion,\u0026quot; with King\u0026rsquo;s reflections on love, hate, and forgiveness, I\u0026rsquo;m guided by two central questions that structure my research: 1) How do love and hate, empathy and disgust, fear and paranoia, shape reactions to and interactions with others in America today, particularly refugees and other racialized groups; and 2) How might we imagine the role of the emotional realm in imagining the political? What is the landscape of feelings that we imagine might bring us closer to justice?\nIn King\u0026rsquo;s speech, he recommends precisely what I and others often struggle to do: to forget without turning a blind eye, to reconcile and to commit to a new start. This, he suggests, is central to loving our enemies.\n Forgiveness does not mean ignoring what has been done or putting a false label on an evil act. It means, rather, that the evil act no longer remains as a barrier to the relationship. Forgiveness is a catalyst creating the atmosphere necessary for a fresh start and a new beginning. It is the lifting of a burden or the cancelling of a debt\u0026hellip; Forgiveness means reconciliation, a coming together again.  In my personal life, Person Who Has Done Me Wrong is someone who, in the context of our relationship, has hurt me in some way big or small, real or imagined. There is an act for which they are being forgiven. But what if the problem is not so much one specific action so much as the fact of your different racial inheritances, privileges had but not earned, or other facts of asymmetry in a relationship? Perhaps this person is not the one who has harmed you, but looks an awful lot like someone who has, or someone who\u0026rsquo;s hurt your ancestors. In Citizen: An American Lyric, her stunning book of poetry, prose, and images, Claudia Rankine captures this phenomenon well, writing:\n A friend argues that Americans battle between the ‘historical self’ and the ‘self self’. By this she means you mostly interact as friends with mutual interest and, for the most part, compatible personalities; however, sometimes your historical selves, her white self and your black self, or your white self and her black self, arrive with the full force of your American positioning. Then you are standing face-to-face in seconds that wipe the affable smiles right from your mouths. What did you say? Instantaneously your attachment seems fragile, tenuous, subject to any transgression of your historical self. And though your joined personal histories are supposed to save you from misunderstandings, they usually cause you to understand all too well what is meant (14).  These interactions, between historical selves and self selves, past and present, wronged and oppressor, letting go and holding on, are the subject of much of my work. They also form the basis of a series of posts I hope to eventually make about emotions, the political, and identity (with an emphasis on race/ethnicity, in particular). More soon.\n","date":1454698451,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454698451,"objectID":"de7c1a125f4594340750f91214dd73de","permalink":"/posts/on-love-and-forgiveness/","publishdate":"2016-02-05T14:54:11-04:00","relpermalink":"/posts/on-love-and-forgiveness/","section":"posts","summary":"A little while ago, I decided to make a project out of forgiveness.

This is a value position with practical and humane consequences and with scientific legitimacy.\u0026rdquo;\n His call to be vital and involved has me thinking about what our professional obligation is as anthropologists (and perhaps scholars in general). This preoccupation started in earnest a few months ago, when I went to see Michelle Alexander speak about The New Jim Crow. While the talk was fascinating, equal parts enraging and inspiring, I have spent the most time since that event thinking about the question and answer session. To be honest, I only really remember one woman, who identified herself as a member of the community. She told us how her son, after fooling around with some of his friends in a local park, was arrested and detained without bail or concrete charges. How she went to visit him in this facility and saw a room full of black boys ages 18-25. How when the bail was set, it was so high she had to mortgage both her house and her parents\u0026rsquo; to pay the fine. She was at a loss to figure out how to get the best legal representation for her son. In desperation and frustration, she e-mailed faculty members across the region who studied mass incarceration, and none of them responded. For her, this was a source of outrage and shock. How could no one have responded to her? What were we here for, studying this stuff, if we aren\u0026rsquo;t going to help community members as they need it?**\nSince then, I have been thinking about what activism means in the academy, and what implications an activist orientation has for our scholarship. More than that, though, what are our obligations to go beyond the production of socially-relevant information? To what extent can and should we be available to our communities? While I had previously considered the extent of my engagement to be the clear, thoughtful, and responsible presentation of my findings, I am wondering: what else I should and could be doing in the future to engage ethically in research?\nThis issue has continued to vex me because like many physician-anthropologists before me, I do not have a neutral stance towards the phenomena that I study. Additionally, as I become more aware of feminisms of color and womanism, I am increasingly thinking of praxis as central to my scholarship. This is all to say that I have a perpetual eye for change, and believe it is my ethical obligation to consider: How can I make use of my position as a physician \u0026amp; a scholar to fight oppressive structures? How can I work to change the systems that I am a part of that contribute to human suffering and inequality?\nAcademic Activism This is a perennial topic, and I am certainly not the first student to wonder how to integrate their activist leanings with their scholarship. I recently read Eric Grollman of Conditionally Accepted\u0026rsquo;s response to Fabio Rojas\u0026rsquo;s critique. Can academics and activism mix? I think, ultimately, I am likely to agree with Dr. Grollman, and cannot imagine engaging in this career without an element of activism. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to avoid the beating that grad school promises (wishful thinking, perhaps?).\nFor my part, I do not want to be separated from the work of, in my case, thinking critically about health care and access. On the one hand, academic critique, rigorous data collection, and creative dissemination of research findings can be instrumental in raising awareness. Dr. Alexander\u0026rsquo;s cross-country travel to promote her work highlights one way that we can become clearly involved in shaping the discourse around key issues in this country. One the other hand, in some ways I decided to become a physician, and to some extent an anthropologist, because I am attracted to the particular. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in reaching out to specific individuals and leveraging the resources and institutional privilege I have to make change. I also wonder what I should be doing now as opposed to later. On the one hand, I\u0026rsquo;m full-time in a strenuous program, and in some ways I feel stretched thin already. On the other hand, I long for more involvement. I long to do the work. I want to be more in touch with what I told myself I\u0026rsquo;m here for. Many of my grad school friends (especially this last, first, semester), express a feeling of disconnection - from ourselves, from the work that sustains us, and from communities that support us. I do feel less active, less involved, and more distant as I slowly surround myself more and more with books and spend the day strapped to my computer. It is becoming clearer, however, that attention to poverty and inequality does not limit us to working outside of academia. Karen Kelsky\u0026rsquo;s recent PhD student debt survey revealed the ridiculous amount of academic debt and poverty in the academy and took my breath away, and numerous articles drive home the point that the academy is in serious trouble. Additionally, a recent Tenure, She Wrote posts breaks the silence surrounding poverty and the amount of inequality that exists within our own ivory walls. Activism is no longer something we do to help \u0026ldquo;them\u0026rdquo; outside of the walls of academia, but an attention to the staggering numbers of contingent faculty and unemployed PhD is vital for us all to address. For now, when I feel like I never leave the academy, becoming more knowledgeable about the issues in academia might provide an outlet for me to be involved in meaningful change in my institution. ** I think I should be clear that I don\u0026rsquo;t mean this post as a critique of the faculty, but more a musing on what the place this sort of engagement holds in anthropology.\n","date":1389206740,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1389206740,"objectID":"dbcdf6d043ab182f9d63037b00f89b52","permalink":"/posts/be-vital-be-engaged/","publishdate":"2014-01-08T14:45:40-04:00","relpermalink":"/posts/be-vital-be-engaged/","section":"posts","summary":"I have spent quite a bit of time thinking about this Gerald Berreman quote from a recent Savage Minds post:\n “Our professional obligation is to present what we know and the inferences we draw from our knowledge as clearly, thoughtfully, and responsibly as we can.","tags":[],"title":"Be Vital, Be Engaged","type":"posts"}]
