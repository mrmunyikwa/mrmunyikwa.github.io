I defended my dissertation, Up from the Dirt: Racializing Refuge, Rupture, and Repair in Philadelphia, in 2019. I will graduate with my MD in 2021, after which I hope to pursue combined residency training in internal medicine and pediatrics (Med/Peds).\nPrior to my time at Penn, I studied at the College of William and Mary, where I was a Murray 1693 Scholar. I graduated in 2011 with a self-designed major in Biochemistry \u0026amp; Molecular Biology and a second major in Anthropology. As an undergrad at William \u0026amp; Mary, I spent much of my time in biology labs, studying molecular biology through the intricacies of protein signaling pathways. This work culminated in my honors thesis. I subsequently spent a brief time at Merck Research Laboratories, where I discovered that while I was passionate about the molecular pathways that lead to disease, I yearned to know more about the other paths – historical, social, political-economic – that so structure patterns of poor health and illness. These interests led me to the combined study of medicine and anthropology.\nA political and medical anthropologist by training, I am most interested in understanding the relationship between political economy, history, and practices of care. My dissertation research explored the experiences of refugees and asylum seekers in Philadelphia and the institutions designed to care for them. I have also conducted research on political ideology in the United States, the use of race in biomedicine, and human rights \u0026amp; humanitarianism both domestically and abroad. Clinically, I am interested in work at the intersection of medicine, rights, and the law and have frequently collaborated with lawyers to advocate for patients.\nAside from research, I am passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration, education at all levels, and service.\nIn my non-academic life, I’m a voracious reader and lifelong diarist, am a consummate digital hoarder and technology fiend, and feel lucky to call the city of Brotherly Love my home.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/michelle-munyikwa-phd/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/michelle-munyikwa-phd/","section":"authors","summary":"I’m currently a student in the joint MD/PhD program in anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.

Updates forthcoming.\nI often receive emails from students who are wondering whether they should pursue medical school, a PhD in anthropology, or both. Because I often have these conversations, I have a sense that there is a dearth of information out there about this career path despite a growing interest in it. This page is an attempt to collect some of my thoughts about dual careers in medicine and anthropology. My thoughts on this are certainly neither exhaustive nor sufficient, but I hope this is one of many resources you can consider as you think about whether to embark upon this path. The other resource I would recommend is the list of physician-scientist programs in anthropology, which you can find here. While the list is always changing, this will give you a good starting place from which to see what schools you might consider attending should you want dual training.\nHere are some answers to the questions that people ask me about this path:\nShould I get an MD/PhD in anthropology? Is it a good idea? Is it worth all the time?\nBy the time you talk to someone in my position, they will likely have a polished answer to this question, giving you the impression that MD/PhD anthropology students were always certain that this is what they wanted to do. While this might be the case for some people, it certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case for me. Deciding to do this was complicated, and at least for me, involved a lot of uncertainty. Here are some questions I normally pose to students when they ask me whether this is the right fit for them:\n What kind of research do you want to do? Which discipline asks the questions you like to ask and answers them in a way that excites you? (Is it possible that you prefer similar \u0026ndash; but different! \u0026ndash; disciplines like public health, health policy, or bioethics?) Do you want to see patients, or do you want to work in the sphere of health? What are your personal life goals? In ten years, what things would have to be true in order for you to be happy? Graduate school and medical school, in most places, will be very culturally different. Do you prefer your time to be structured by other people or by yourself? Do you feel flexible about switching between the two? What kinds of skills do you need to do the things that you want? What are your strengths, and where do you have room for growth? What specialties are you interested in? Are these specialties traditionally ones which allow for robust careers in research? What kinds of financial resources do you have, and what are your financial goals? Are they compatible with an extended period living on a graduate student salary? What benefits do your prospective programs offer?  The answer to these questions can absolutely be I don\u0026rsquo;t know! but they are starting points for reflection about what might be right for you. I also often suggest to students that they take a period of time to read from different fields and ask themselves what kinds of scholarship they enjoy reading? Are those books? Short articles? Qualitative or quantitative work? Remember that enjoying reading a particular kind of scholarship is not the same as wanting to produce it, so thinking about the process of research can be important as well.\nUltimately, I love being an anthropologist, and I would highly recommend training in anthropology! If you need to talk through whether it\u0026rsquo;s right for you \u0026ndash; and whether a dual career makes sense for your goals \u0026ndash; reaching out to mentors who are faculty that you admire and students you hope to emulate is a great first start.\nDo you think I\u0026rsquo;m competitive for programs?\nI sincerely wish I knew the answer to this, but being competitive for these programs is multi-factorial. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to talk through your concerns with you and establish a plan for getting you towards your goals.\nWhere do you recommend I look for community and mentorship?\nAs a first step, I highly recommend that, if you are able, you attend the National Conference for Physician-Scholars in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Every other year, trainees and faculty gather to discuss research \u0026amp; strengthen our community. While there is strong representation from anthropology and history, each year an increasing number of sociologists, public health scholars, epidemiologists, and other social scientists or humanists attend. If you are unable to make it, one resource which could show you the diversity of careers and research are the programs. There, you can find scholars doing research of various kinds and it may point you to people and institutions that share your interests.\n","date":1590024177,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590024177,"objectID":"9d9d68908a12c6967b7e69f401d2cfa8","permalink":"/page/for-prospective-students/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T21:22:57-04:00","relpermalink":"/page/for-prospective-students/","section":"page","summary":"This page is a work in progress, but as application season is coming up, I wanted to put this out there!

My dissertation places care for refugees and other humanitarian migrants in political, economic, and social context with a particular emphasis on broader patterns of racial discrimination and state-sanctioned violence. Responding to that, the project explores the intersection of care and governance in Philadelphia through the lens of displacement, beginning with an ethnographic study of refugees and the institutions in Philadelphia that serve them. I analyze Philadelphia as a place formed through migration and displacement, from successive refugee migrations beginning in the 20th century to other movements, like the Great Migration, that have shaped demographic patterns and social life in the city of Brotherly Love. Drawing from a large, diverse archive that brings news, personal narratives and oral histories, and cultural representations both past and present into conversation with semi-structured interviews and ethnographic participant-observation at multiple sites, my work strives to understand what making refuge looks like and for whom asylum is possible.\nMy analytic framework draws from literatures about humanitarianism, affect, and the anthropology of the state to understand how refugee resettlement in Philadelphia is inflected with the politics of race, gender, and class. Drawing from feminist theory and queer of color critique, I explore comparative racialization through a framework that recognizes how groups are racialized with respect to one another through competing racial formations at the same time that it accounts for heterogeneity within racial categories. I do so through a particular attentiveness to state bureaucratic processes, from welfare applications to public health management, as they are negotiated by healthcare providers, case workers, and volunteers, not to mention refugees and asylum seekers themselves.\nAs a Black woman, an immigrant, and a future health care provider, I try to think carefully about the social, political, and economic dynamics that care – however well-intentioned – both shapes and is shaped by. I’m also hopeful that in theorizing displacement and refuge, we can reconsider what justice can and should look like for racialized people. Thinking as such might allow us to imagine a reparative politics that offers new possibilities for the future.\nFor a different articulation of what I study, here’s a blurb about my work on Anthro News.

In my mind, what links my seemingly disparate careers in medicine and anthropology is the centrality and importance of teaching. For me, learning to be an educator is one of the most vital components of being a clinician-scholar: it allows us to both disseminate and produce new knowledge, it provides a pipeline of future scholars, and it is an avenue for justice and equity in research and education. My teaching philosophy draws from my background and training as a future clinician/anthropologist and enables students at several levels (undergraduate, graduate, and medical school) to develop the tools to understand complex issues at the intersection of medicine and society.\nAt the undergraduate level, I have served as a teaching assistant for both large survey courses and small upper-division seminars. I\u0026rsquo;ve also designed courses in medical anthropology at multiple universities. My undergraduate courses emphasize growth and maturation over initial competence, rewarding students for their efforts to become more effective thinkers and writers through low-stakes assignments early in the semester that build confidence and allow learners to acclimate to the challenges of thinking anthropologically. Through in-class exercises like debates and media critiques, we work together as a class to collectively produce knowledge that draws upon their personal experiences of health and healing and contextualizes their narratives within the communities in which they live. Further, learners understand the complexities of caregiving across settings, in particular the unintended consequences of these practices. On my journey to becoming an educator, I\u0026rsquo;ve taken courses in teaching at the college level.\nI developed a similar approach at the medical school level, where I have been involved in course design, implementation, and evaluation for a required course in the medical social sciences. For two years, I served as the Course Liaison for the School of Medicine’s introductory social medicine course, Doctoring IA: Introduction to Medicine and Society. As co-director of the course, I selected weekly lecturers and course readings that could appeal to 165 students with varying levels of exposure and interest in the medical humanities and social sciences, social medicine, and public health. Through a certificate in medical education at Penn, I am strengthening my skills as a clinical educator, from the classroom to the wards.\nFor copies of my syllabi, please e-mail me.\n","date":1589917438,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589917438,"objectID":"9b99810a45e0a5f0aa081103d67301a9","permalink":"/page/teaching/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T15:43:58-04:00","relpermalink":"/page/teaching/","section":"page","summary":"I love teaching and mentorship.
